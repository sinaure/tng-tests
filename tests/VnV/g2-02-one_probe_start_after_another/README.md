| __Test sequence__ | Step | Description | Result |
| | 1 | Service Package On-Boarding | Service Package is on-boarded in VnV catalog|
| | 2 | Test Package On-Boarding | Test Package is on-boarded in VnV catalog|
| | 3 | Check Service Instantiation | Service instance is up and running |
| | 4 | Check Test Execution | VnV launches and executes the test |
| | 5 | Check Test Completion | VnV test execution is completed |
| | 6 | Check No Running Instances In SP | After test, the instantiated service must be deleted from Service Platform|
| | 7 | Check Stored Results | The test results are stored in the test results repository |  
| __Test Verdict__ | | The results will show content from the probes | |
