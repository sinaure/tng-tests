# test_sdk07_vim-emu-scalability

Owner: Manuel (UPB)

This test aims to evaluate the scalability of vim-emu. The results are based on a recently published paper with 5GTANGO ack.:

M. Peuster, M. Marchetti, G. Garcia de Blas, Holger Karl: [Automated testing of NFV orchestrators against carrier-grade multi-PoP scenarios using emulation-based smoke testing](https://ris.uni-paderborn.de/record/10325). In EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking (2019)

We can directly use these results for D6.3 (see `plots/`). Details about the experiment setups can be found in the paper. We are not going to re-run the tests again since the results provide numbers with sufficient quality.

**Note:** Cross check with old deliverables to not use duplicated plots.
