## Artifacts

* [5GTANGO packages (`*.tgo`) build by Jenkins](https://jenkins.sonata-nfv.eu/job/tng-tests/)

## Jenkins Integration

There is a Jenkins job to automatically build some of the artifacts stored in this repositry. For example, the Jenkins job automatically packages the SDK projects available in the `packages/` folder. The resulting `*.tgo` files are then available as [artifacts within Jenkins](https://jenkins.sonata-nfv.eu/job/tng-tests/).
